# Structured artifact flow

Every arrow below is a serialized, validated boundary. Model prose is retained only as
an explanation field inside a typed artifact; it is never forwarded as an actuator command.

| Stage | Structured input | Structured output | Consumer and gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request intake | `MissionRequest`, `ConversationWindow`, `MapCatalog` | `IntentArtifact` | Intent critic checks ambiguity and map grounding |
| Intent critique | Request + intent + catalog | `IntentCritique` | Bounded loop repairs intent or fails |
| Contract freeze | Accepted intent | `MissionContract` | Exact ID must later be confirmed by the operator |
| Decomposition | Frozen contract + bounded context | `TaskGraphArtifact` | IDs, dependencies, task types, and semantic targets validated |
| Semantic planning | Contract + task graph + map catalog | `SemanticPlan` | Tool layer resolves geometry |
| Route tool | `RouteQuery` + qualified graph | `GraphRoute` + `ToolReceipt` | Generic shortest-path and flight-verification constraints |
| Clearance tool | Route + semantic collision geometry + vehicle envelope | `RouteClearanceReport` + receipt | Zero forbidden collisions and minimum clearance |
| PX4 track tool | `Px4TrackRequest` + graph + `MapRuntimeBindings` | `Px4Track` + receipt | ENU/world/NED coordinate contract and complete collision-center offset frozen |
| Plan critique | Plan + route + clearance + track summaries | `PlanCritique` | Bounded repair loop; model cannot waive tool failures |
| Preparation | All accepted artifacts + call records + receipts | `PreparedMission` | Canonical hash binds the entire prepared mission |
| Task lifecycle | Conversation + prepared hash + source-message hash | `TaskThread`, `PlanRevisionRecord`, `MissionLifecycleBinding` | Same mission ID; old revision superseded atomically |
| Launch | Prepared mission + explicit contract ID + file hashes | Runtime process set | Any mismatch fails before launch |
| Runtime message ingress | Active `RuntimeControlSession` + user text | `RuntimeUserMessage` | Exact conversation, mission, plan, contract, and execution IDs required |
| Immediate hold | Runtime message + PX4 telemetry | `RuntimeHoldAcknowledgement` | Old track and semantic side effects disabled before any model call |
| Runtime classification | Message + stable-hold evidence + current mission | `RuntimeInterruptionDecision` | Code alone authorizes resume, replan hold, or landing |
| Runtime reroute | Decision + hold telemetry + map graph + map semantics + vehicle envelope | `RuntimeReplacementTrack` | Target grounding, route, continuous clearance, hashes, and prior-track binding must all pass |
| Checkpoint | `RuntimeCheckpointRequest` | `RuntimeCheckpointDecision` | Code recomputes binding and safety authorization |
| Runtime collection | Gazebo poses + ROS observations + PX4 state/ULog + process/timing records | `Px4GazeboRunEvidence` | Deterministic gates evaluate observed execution |
| Completion review | Prepared mission + bounded evidence summary | `CompletionAssessment` | Advisory review only |
| Final acceptance | Runtime evidence + completion assessment + hash-linked ledger | `SimulationWorkflowResult` | `verified` only when every mandatory code gate passes |

Preparation artifacts are never sufficient evidence that a flight succeeded.

The PX4 ULog is large and may remain in PX4's runtime log directory. Its exact path,
size, and SHA-256 are included in runtime evidence. A portable acceptance manifest may
therefore prove which log was used without committing the binary log to Git.

## Coordinate contract

Map nodes and Gazebo observations use world ENU meters. The offboard executor converts
each validated world point to PX4 local NED using the frozen origin and axis mapping in
`Px4CoordinateContract`. Runtime checkpoint requests carry both semantic identity and
route/track indices so a plausible-looking position from another segment cannot authorize
continuation.

Every `dronedream.map-semantic.v1` document must contain a
`dronedream.map-runtime-bindings.v1` object under `runtime_bindings`. It declares the
simulator, ENU vehicle spawn, the complete X/Y/Z vehicle collision-center offset, and the
qualified mission launch waypoint. Qualification fails before planning if any field is
missing, non-finite, or outside the supported offset envelope. Historical map schemas and
`simulation_bindings` are rejected before planning; no retired School Map field name can
reach the generic Harness or PX4 track tool.

## Changing a contract

1. Update the Pydantic model in `contracts.py`.
2. Update every producer and consumer in the same change.
3. Run `python scripts/export_schemas.py`.
4. Run `python scripts/export_schemas.py --check`, Ruff, and pytest.
5. Re-run the relevant real ROS/Gazebo/PX4 acceptance level; unit tests alone are not
   evidence of simulator compatibility.
